# This program is a simple way that you can do something to make "for" act like while
# I mean , to make "for " not to stop and continues ...
# Make a list to be able to put it after "for x in" 
List = [1 , 2]

# Then write the "for" part...
for x in List:  
    a = input("Enter > ")#we write it to control the for , if we don't it print unlimited...
    # and write something to append a number in your list in each movement    
    List.append(1)

    # As you see it append a number again and again , so x never reaches to our list
